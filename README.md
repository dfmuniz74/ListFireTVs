# ListFireTVs

## üìå About the Project

The **ListFireTVs** is a PowerShell script designed to list Fire TV devices connected to the network. It quickly identifies Fire TV devices and can be useful for automation or troubleshooting.

## üîç Alternative Discovery Methods  

Fire TVs typically announce their services on the network via mDNS (Bonjour). If you're interested in other ways to discover Fire TVs on your network, you can use the following methods:  

- **On Windows (using dns-sd.exe from Bonjour)**  
  You can search for devices advertising `_amzn-wplay._tcp.local` on [Windows](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/54216363/how-to-install-the-dns-sd-command-line-test-tool-on-windows-or-linux) with:
  ```powershell
  dns-sd -B _amzn-wplay._tcp

- **On Linux/macOS (using avahi-browse)**
  While this script is designed for Windows, you can also discover Fire TVs on [Linux/macOS](https://gist.github.com/davisford/5984768) with:
  ```sh
  avahi-browse -a | grep "Fire"
